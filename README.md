## Steps followed to setup the project

### Setting up server and database

1. Initialise a package.json file by entering the following command in terminal, after getting into the project directory :

```(bash)
npm init
```

2. Install npm packages required for backend side :

```(bash)
npm i express body-parser mongoose concurrently
npm i -D nodemon
```

3. Create a file server.js to make use of the express packages 

4. Modify the package.json by adding the following scripts to it :

```(JSON)
  "start": "node server.js",
  "server": "nodemon server.js",
```

5. Create an account on MongoDB cloud Atlas, thereafter, creating a database on it and get your MongoURI exported from a file keys.js in a folder config

6. Modify server.js to get connected to the database, using the MongoURI and also add the following lines at the end of server.js :

```(JavaScript)
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, ()=> console.log(`Server started running on port ${port}`));
```

7. Type the following command to get your server running on your localhost and ensure hot-reloading, when the server-side code is modified :

```(bash)
npm run server
```

8. Make Schemas for various collections to be stored in database and export them from a folder models and the REST APIs for various routes in the folder routes. Change the server.js accordingly to make the use of these REST APIs. Ensure that the APIs are working correctly, by making requests using POSTMAN

9. Add JWT token based authentication and 'cors' module and use them in server.js. 

### Setting up the React client

1. Create a folder 'client' in the project directory. Ensure that you have create-react-app CLI installed. Enter the following commands in terminal :

```(bash)
cd client
create-react-app .
cd ..
```

2. In the package.json of the server, add the following scripts :

```(JSON)
"client-install": "npm install --prefix client",
"client": "npm start --prefix client",
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" ",
```

3. Remove all the additional default setup from client folder like logo, index.css, etc. Then, configure the client to make use of *bootstrap* and *reactstrap* to make the app responsive by using following commands in terminal :

```(bash)
cd client
npm i bootstrap reactstrap react-popper font-awesome bootstrap-social
```

Add the following line to index.js :

```(JavaScript)
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

4. Install Redux for maintaining the state :

```(Terminal)
npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk
```

5. Create a redux store, the various actions and reducers required in a folder named redux. Make corresponding changes in the React components to map the actions and state to props
